    "\n",
    "I believe I've seen C/Fortran matrix packages that made quite good use of this. The representation would be a simple 1-dimensional sequence. You'd normally not see or use this, but it would be there if you needed access to it (e.g. for passing to C/Fortran code).\n",

    "To make efficient use of this, I propose that slicing and indexing, as long as they return an object of rank >= 1, return an object that points into the same representation sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "I propose one additional feature (which I believe I saw in Algol-68; some matrix packages may also use it): add a \"stride\" to each dimension (including the last). This makes it possible to have slices reference discontiguous parts of the underlying representation, and even to represent a transposed version!\n",
    "\n",
