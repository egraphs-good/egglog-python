# Changelog

_This project uses semantic versioning_

## UNRELEASED

## 7.0.0 (2024-04-27)

- Defers adding rules in functions until they are used, so that you can use types that are not present yet.
- Removes ability to set custom default ruleset for egraph. Either just use the empty default ruleset or explicitly set it for every run
- Automatically mark Python builtin operators as preserved if they must return a real Python value
- Properly pretty print all items (rewrites, actions, exprs, etc) so that expressions are de-duplicated and state is handled correctly.
- Add automatic releases from github manual action

## 6.1.0 (2024-03-06)

- Upgrade [egglog](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/compare/4cc011f6b48029dd72104a38a2ca0c7657846e0b...0113af1d6476b75d4319591cc3d675f96a71cdc5)
  - Adds subsume action
- Makes all objects besides EGraphs "sendable" aka threadsafe ([#129](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog-python/pull/129))

## 6.0.1 (2024-02-28)

- Upgrade dependencies, including [egglog](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/compare/ceed816e9369570ffed9feeba157b19471dda70d...4cc011f6b48029dd72104a38a2ca0c7657846e0b)
- Fix bug where saturate wasn't properly getting translated.

## 6.0.0 (2024-02-06)

### Remove modules / Auto register functions/classes

You can now create classes and functions without an EGraph! They will be automatically registered on any EGraph if they
are used in any of the rules or commands. This means the methods to add functions/classes on an EGraph are deprecated and
moved to the top level module:

- `egraph.class_` -> Removed, simply subclass from `egglog.Expr`
- `egraph.method` -> `egglog.method`
- `egraph.function` -> `egglog.function`
- `egraph.relation` -> `egglog.relation`
- `egraph.ruleset` -> `egglog.Ruleset`
- `egraph.Module` -> Removed

The goal of this change is to remove the complexity of `Module`s and remove the need to think about what functions/classes
need to be registered for each `EGraph`.

In turn, if you want to collect a set of rules, you can do that with a ruleset. Whenever you now run a ruleset or schedule,
the ruleset will be automatically registered on the EGraph.

For backwards compatability, the existing methods and functions are preserved, to make this easier to adopt. They will
all now raise deprication warnings.

### Allow future type references in classes

Classes can now reference types that have not been defined yet, as long as they are defined before the class is used in a
rule or expression. For example:

```python
class A(Expr):
    def __init__(self, b: B) -> None: ...

class B(Expr):
    ...
```

### Top level commands

We can now simplify and check expressions without explicity making an EGraph:

```python
check(<fact>, [<schedule>], *[<actions>])
# is equivalent to
e = EGraph()
e.register(*<actions>)
e.run(<schedule>)
e.check(<fact>)

simplify(<expr>, [<schedule>])
# is equivalent to
EGraph().simplify(<expr>, [<schedule>])
```

## 5.0.0 (2024-01-16)

- Move egglog `!=` function to be called with `ne(x).to(y)` instead of `x != y` so that user defined expressions
  can

## 4.0.1 (2023-11-27)

- Fix keyword args for `__init__` methods (#96)[https://github.com/metadsl/egglog-python/pull/96].

## 4.0.0 (2023-11-24)

- Fix `as_egglog_string` proprety.
- Move `EGraph.eval_fn` to `py_eval_fn` since it doesn't need the `EGraph` anymore.

## 3.1.0 (2023-11-21)

- Update graphs to include more compact Python names of functions (#79)[https://github.com/metadsl/egglog-python/pull/79].
- Add `as_egglog_string` property to get egglog source from e-graph (#82)[https://github.com/metadsl/egglog-python/pull/82].
- Add `include_cost` flag to `egraph.extract` to return the integer cost as well as an expression (#86)[https://github.com/metadsl/egglog-python/pull/86].
- Automatically try converting arguments to `eq`, `rewrite`, `set_`, and `union` to the correct type (#84)[https://github.com/metadsl/egglog-python/pull/84].
- Update RTD name to new project name of `egglog-python` from `egg-smol-python` (#18)[https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog-python/pull/18].
- Move project to egraphs-good org!

## 3.0.0 (2023-11-19)

Add support for outputing the serialization e-graph from the low level bindings. Note that this is not yet exposed a the high level yet.

This removes the existing to graphviz function on the EGraph low level binding and moves it to a method on the serialized EGraph.

See (#78)[https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog-python/pull/78] for more details.

## 2.0.0 (2023-11-17)

## Simplify accessing primitives

Previously, there was no public way of turning an egglog primitive, i.e. `i64(10)`, into a Python primitive, i.e. `int(10)`. Now there is a `egraph.eval(...)` method which will evaluate a primitive expression and return a Python object.

We also change the `PyObject` primitive to behave similarly. Instead of calling `egraph.load_object(pyobj)` you can now call `egraph.eval(pyobj)` to get the underlying Python object. Also, to unify it with the other objects, you can create a `PyObject` by using the constructor instead of `egraph.save_object(pyobj)`.

## Bug fixes

- Properly expose `birewrite` at top level (#72)[https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog-python/pull/72].
- Fix generation of graphviz interactive SVGs in docs.
