`egglog` is a Python package that provides bindings to the Rust library [`egglog`](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/),
allowing you to use e-graphs in Python for optimization, symbolic computation, and analysis.

Please see the [documentation](https://egglog-python.readthedocs.io/) for more information.
